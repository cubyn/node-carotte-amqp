feat: expose :describe-durable queues

When a queue is set with `exclusive: true, durable: false`, when the
nodes are recreated during a maintenance, the queues may come into a
corrupted state where they are still linked to the old node.

When that happens, the `channel.assertQueue` method hangs forever
without giving an error message, making it particularily hard to debug.
Also, the only way to fix the corrupted state is to manually delete the
queue. Automating it is made harder by the fact that the queues in such
state are not listed in the rabbitmq console, only on the rabbitmq UI.

We cannot simply update the code to provide `durable: true` for
`:describe` queues, since when the queue already exists, `assertQueue`
fails with `PRECONDITION_FAILED`, because the options have changed.
Basically, the options used to initially create the queue are immutable.

The release plan is therefore to:

1. add `:describe-durable` queues, which have `durable: true` and do the
   same thing, return the `meta` object.
2. upgrade all agents that publish to the `:describe` queue to
   publish to the `:describe-durable` queue.
3. once all agents have been upgraded,

describe queues are used by:

1. `gateway-rest` to discover available controllers, and reject requests
   made to unknown endpoints (in case carotte describe invoke fails).
2. `carotte-cli` to retrieve request and response schemas of endpoints
